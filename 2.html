  <p>
    Some type sheets, or Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), are languages ​​that describe how a markup language is actually displayed [1], primarily for HTML and XHTML, and XML-enabled. It's a W3C standard, and there's a lot of freedom when it comes to defining layouts and styles.If the markup language (ex: HTML) is responsible for the body of the website, CSS is responsible for decorating it like clothes and accessories. In other words, you can decorate a website like a completely different website by changing the CSS file while leaving the HTML structure intact.
